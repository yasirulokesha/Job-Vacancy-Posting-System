        A web-based job management platform designed to streamline the process of posting, viewing, and applying for job vacancies. Built with PHP, HTML/CSS, and MySQL, the system supports user registration, role-based access (admin/employer/jobseeker), job listings, and application tracking. Ideal for small-scale recruitment or academic demonstration of CRUD and authentication functionality.
